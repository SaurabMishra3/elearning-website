	<h1>Mobile app development</h1>
	<h4>Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. <br>These software applications are designed to run on mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. <br>These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms,<br> or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a Web browser. <br>Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms.<br> Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. <br>A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU then 28 members (including the UK), 60 percent of which are mobile app developers.[1]<br>

As part of the development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is also essential in the creation of mobile apps.<br> Mobile UI considers constraints, contexts, screen, input, and mobility as outlines for design.<br> The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software.<br> User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation.<br> Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size for a user's hand(s).<br> Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity, such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile app.<br> Overall, mobile UI design's goal is mainly for an understandable, user-friendly interface.<br> The UI of mobile apps should: consider users' limited attention, minimize keystrokes, and be task-oriented with a minimum set of functions.<br> This functionality is supported by mobile enterprise application platforms or integrated development environments (IDEs).<br><br>

Mobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems.<br> The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration.<br> This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components including mobile app server, mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), and service-oriented architecture (SOA) infrastructure.<br>
